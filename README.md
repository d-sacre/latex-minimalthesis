# latex-minimalthesis v0.0.1-alpha, 2023-09-27
A LaTeX class for typesetting natural science theses. Built upon scrreprt and pgfkeys.

The first (more or less proof-of-concept) release of the minimalthesis "class". Still uses the \input{} approach and komavars to achieve the desired functionality. It is very rough, but should work in theory and could be used by experienced users in a production environment (but is NOT ADVISED).
